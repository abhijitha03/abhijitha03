### 🌌 who am i?

i'm currently orbiting through my B.Tech in computer science (with a focus on AIML) —  
trying to connect the dots between logic, intuition, and impact.  

i’m all about building things that just *make sense*.  
from machine learning models that quietly solve complex problems  
to interfaces that feel smoother than low-Earth orbit.

i believe good code doesn't scream for attention — it flows.  
quietly powerful. clean. intentional.

### 🧠 what fuels me

- exploring how machines learn and *why* they fail  
- tweaking models until they start acting like they “get it”  
- translating real-world messiness into structured insight  
- adding small details that make big differences  
- understanding humans through the lens of systems and signals

### 🔧 tools in my current flight pack

`Python` · `TensorFlow` · `Pandas` · `Sklearn`  
`HTML` · `CSS` · `JavaScript` · `SQL`  

(and the occasional `CTRL + Z` when things crash mid-orbit)

### 🪐 philosophies i live by

> "code is like space — mostly silent, but filled with potential."  

> "if the problem seems too big, zoom out. look at the bigger picture."

> "the best builds feel less like work and more like alignment."

### 👀 where i'm headed

- growing systems that grow with people  
- building for clarity, not just complexity  
- finding beauty in the logic, rhythm in the workflow  
- making things work, and making them *worth it*
